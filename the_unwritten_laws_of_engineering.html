			<p>When my editor inquired about my interest in updating <b><i>The Unwritten Laws of Engineering</i></b>, I was delighted for the opportunity. The book had first been published as three articles in <b><i>Mechanical Engineering</i></b> in 1944, and was reprinted most recently in 1994, substantially unchanged from the original. When first reading it a few years ago, I was surprised at how well its advice had held up over the decades. Except for a few omissions and outdated laws, it seemed equally as fitting then as it must have been over fifty years before, and it was a lot of fun to read.</p>
			<p>The biggest challenge was updating the book without ruining it altogether. Indeed, a common response from readers on what to change was: "Don't change anything. Why would you want to?" Well, some things just plain demanded it. At the same time, a new edition needed to retain timelessness; after all, the original survived more than half a century in fairly good health.</p>
			<p>So, this updated edition keeps the style of the original and much of its content. Changes have to do with shifted societal values, changed employment laws, and evolved corporate structures. No apology is offered for the lack of reference to the latest technology (e-mail, computers, internet) this book's advice transcends the mere implements of the engineer. Some words and phrases in the original were painfully archaic and have been changed, but many of the old-fashioned words remain — they add to the fun.</p>
			<p>Although I wish to thank all those who helped with the text, Jennifer Kern, Dr. Steven Kern, and John Gillespie get special, personal thank-you's. Above all, I wish to acknowledge the original author, W. J. King. He mined and cut a little gem, and I am privileged to have been able to reset it.</p>

			<p>Prior to writing the first text of this book, the originating author admitted to having become very much aware, which can be observed in any engineering organization, that the chief obstacles to the success of individual engineers or of groups of engineers are of a personal and administrative rather than a technical nature. It was apparent that both he and his associates were getting into much more trouble by violating the undocumented laws of professional conduct than by committing technical sins against the well-documented laws of science. Since the former appeared to be unwritten at that time, "laws" were formulated and collected into a scrapbook as a professional code of sorts. Although they were, and in this latest edition still are fragmentary and incomplete, they are offered here for whatever they may be worth to younger engineers just starting their careers, and to older ones who know these things perfectly well but who all too often fail to apply them.</p>
			<p>None of these laws is theoretical or imaginary, and however obvious they may appear, their repeated violation is responsible for much of the frustration and embarrassment to which engineers everywhere are liable. In fact, the first edition of this book was primarily a record derived from direct observation over 17 years of four engineering departments, three of them newly organized and struggling to establish themselves by trial-and-error. It has been supplemented, confirmed, and updated by the experience of others as gathered from numerous discussions, observations, and literature, so that it most emphatically does not reflect the unique experience or characteristics of any one organization.</p>

					<p>Many young engineers feel that the minor chores of a technical project are beneath their dignity and unworthy of their college training. They expect to prove their true worth in some major, vital enterprise. Actually, the spirit and effectiveness with which you tackle your first humble tasks will very likely be carefully watched and may affect your entire career.</p>
					<p>Ocasionally you may worry unduly about where your job is going to get you - whether it is sufficiently strategic or significant. Of course these are pertinent considerations and you would do well to take some stock of them. But by and large, it is fundamentally true that if you take care of your present job well, the future will take care of itself. This is particularly so within large corporations, which constantly search for competent people to move into more responsible positions. Success depends so largely upon personality, native ability, and vigorous, intelligent prosecution of any job that it is no exaggeration to say that your ultimate chances are much better if you do a good job on some minor detail than if you do a mediocre job as a project leader. Furthermore, it is also true that if you do not first make a good showing on your present job you are not likely to be given the opportunity to try something else more to your liking.</p>

					<p>This is a quality that may be achieved by various means under different circumstances. Specific aspects will be elaborated in some of the succeeding paragraphs. It can probably be reduced, however, to a combination of three basic characteristics:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>initiative, which is expressed in energy to start things and aggressiveness to keep them moving briskly,</li>
						<li>resourcefulness or ingenuity, i.e., the faculty for finding ways to accomplish the desired result, and</li>
						<li>persistence (tenacity), which is the disposition to persevere in spite of difficulties, discouragement, or indifference.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This last quality is sometimes lacking in the make-up of brilliant engineers to such an extent that their effectiveness is greatly reduced. Such dilettantes are known as "good starters but poor finishers." Or else it will be said: "You can't take their type too seriously; they will be all steamed up over an idea today, but by tomorrow will have dropped it for some other wild notion." Bear in mind, therefore, that it may be worthwhile finishing it.</p>

					<p>This is one of the first things a new engineer must learn in entering a manufacturing organization. Many novices assume that it is sufficient to make a request or order, then sit back and wait until the goods or services are delivered. Most jobs progress in direct proportion to the amount of follow-up and expediting that is applied to them. Expediting means planning, investigating, promoting, and facilitating every step in the process. Cultivate the habit of looking immediately for some way around each obstacle encountered, some other recourse or expedient to keep the job rolling without losing momentum.</p>
					<p>On the other hand, the matter is ocasionally overdone by overzealous individuals who make themselves obnoxious and antagonize everyone with their incessant pestering. Be careful about demanding action from others. Too much insistence and agitation may result in more damage to one's personal interest than could ever result from the miscarriage of the item involved.</p>

					<p>Any trip to the field, whether for having a design review, resolving a complaint, analyzing a production problem, investigating a failure, calling on a customer, visiting a supplier, or attending a trade show, deserves your special attention to return the maximum benefit for the time and expense. Although each business trip will be unique, and the extent to which you must do the following will be different for each, as a minimum, be sure to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Plan the travel. This is more than just reserving transportation and hotels. Consider all eventualities such as lost luggage, missed connections, late arrivals, unusual traffic. Those you are meeting have arranged their schedules for you, so don't disappoint them arrive on time and ready to perform. Follow the motto: "If you can't be on time, be early!"</li>
						<li>Plan and prepare for the business to be done. Prepare and distribute agendas before you arrive. Send ahead any material to be reviewed. Be sure everything (e.g., samples, prototypes, presentations) is complete. Practice any presentations, however minor they might seem, beforehand. In short, be fully prepared and allow those you visit to prepare fully.</li>
						<li>Complete the business at hand. You will not always be able to carry out a business trip to your complete satisfaction; others may control the outcome to a different conclusion. <br>Nevertheless, if you have been sent out to complete a specific task, perhaps to analyze a failure or observe a product in use, and the allotted time proves inadequate for whatever reason, stay until the job is complete. Neither your supervisor nor those you visit will like it if another engineer has to be sent out later to finish what you did not.</li>
						<li>Execute the appropriate follow-up. Often a seemingly successful trip will come to nothing without adequate follow-up. Use meeting minutes, trip reports, and further communications to your best advantage.</li>

It is seldom adequate to remain at one's desk and speculate about causes and solutions, or to retreat to drawings, specifications, and reports and hope to sort it all out. Before ever being able to solve a problem, you will need abundant insight, insight that can only be developed by observing first-hand what might be at once too subtle and complex only to imagine (Ferguson, p. 56).</p>

					<p>If there is one most irksome encumbrance to promoting urgency in the workplace, it is the person who takes a half-hour of rambling discourse to say what could be said in one sentence of 20 words. There is a curious and widespread tendency among engineers to surround the answer to a simple question with so many preliminaries and commentaries that the answer itself can hardly be discerned. It is so difficult to get a direct answer out of some engineers that their usefulness is thereby greatly diminished. The tendency is to explain the answer before answering the question. To be sure, very few questions endure simple answers without qualifications, but the important thing is to state the essence of the matter as succinctly as possible first. On the other hand, there are times when it is important to add the pertinent background or other relevant facts to illuminate a simple statement. The trick is to convey the maximum of significant information in the minimum time, a valuable asset to anyone.</p>
					<p>An excellent guide in this respect may be found in the literary construction called the "inverted pyramid." Start at the bottom — the beginning — with the single most important fact, the one the audience must know before learning more. Often this is the conclusion itself. Progressively broaden the pyramid by constructing each sentence to build upon its predecessor. In this way you will be able to clearly explain even complicated, abstract concepts to anyone. Even if by the end the explanation has become too complex for some, you can take smug comfort knowing that, because you began with your primary point, or the conclusion, or the simple answer, everyone understands you. You can hardly do better than to adopt this method in your communication, presenting your facts in the order of importance, as journalists often do, as if you might be cut off at any minute.</p>

					<p>This seems almost trite, and yet many engineers lose the confidence of their superiors and associates by habitually guessing when they do not know the answer to a direct question. It is important to be able to answer questions concerning your responsibilities, but a wrong answer is worse than no answer. If you do not know, say so, but also say, "I'll find out right away." If you are not certain, indicate the exact degree of certainty or approximation upon which your answer is based. A reputation for dependability and reliability can be one of your most valuable assets.</p>
					<p>This applies, of course, to written matter, calculations, etc., as well as to oral reports and discussions. It is bad business to submit a report for approval without first carefully checking it yourself, and yet formal reports are sometimes turned in, or worse, sent out, full of glaring errors and omissions.</p>

					<p>This is a corollary of the preceding rule: "Every manager must know what goes on. . . ." The main question is: How much must a manager know — how many of the details? This is always a difficult matter for the new employee to get straight. Many novices hesitate to bother their superiors with everyday minutiae, and it is certainly true that it can be overdone in this direction, but in by far the majority of cases the manager's problem is to extract enough information to keep adequately posted. It is a much safer course to risk having your supervisor say, "Don't bother me with so many details," than to allow your supervisor to say, "Why doesn't someone tell me these things?" Bear in mind that your manager is constantly called upon to account for, defend, and explain your activities to others, as well as to coordinate these activities into a larger plan. Compel yourself to provide all the information that is needed for these purposes.</p>
					<p>No matter how hard you try nor how good an engineer you become, technical difficulties — unexpected problems or failures — will occur that you will dread having to inform your supervisor about. The best you can hope to do is to develop solutions to such problems so that you can present these along with the problem, and so that they can be implemented with the greatest urgency. No manager will like being surprised by unanticipated problems (although you are obligated to report them without hesitation), but you will improve your predicament immeasurably if you also bring solid recommendations for solutions.</p>

Sometimes they move a little faster that way, for a while, but sooner or later they find that such tactics cannot be tolerated in a large organization. Generally speaking, you cannot get by whoever evaluates your performance, for he or she rates you on your ability to cooperate, among other things. Besides, most of us get more satisfaction out of our jobs when we're able to display at least some personal loyalty to our superiors, with the feeling that we're helping them to get the main job done.</p>

					<p>For most neophyte engineers, the influence of the senior engineers with whom they work, and even more so, the engineer to whom they report, is a major factor in molding their professional character. Long before the days of universities and textbooks, master craftsmen absorbed their skills by apprenticing to master craftsmen. Likewise, you will do well to use those with more experience, especially a well-selected supervisor, as your master, your mentor. A properly selected mentor will likely have been through gauntlets as severe as your present one, and will guide you through it much easier than you alone can.</p>
					<p>But, of course, it is not always possible to choose a boss advisedly. What if yours turns out to be no more than half the supervisor you hoped for? There are only two proper alternatives open to you: (1) accept your boss as the representative of a higher authority and execute his or her policies and directives as effectively as possible, or (2) move to some other department, division, or company at the first opportunity. A great deal of mischief can be done to the interests of all concerned, including your company, if some other alternative is elected. Consider the damage to the efficiency of a military unit when the privates, disliking the leader, ignore or modify orders to suit their individual notions! To be sure, a business organization is not an army, but neither is it a mob.</p>

It is simply unacceptable either not to do it, or to do something different instead.

					<p>This is a common offense, which causes no end of trouble. Exceptions will occur in respect to minor details, but the rule applies particularly to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><i>The employment of a subordinate</i>. Never offer anyone a job, or broach the matter at all, without first securing the permission of his or her manager. There may be excellent reasons why that person should not be disturbed.</li>
						<li><i>Engaging the time or committing the services of someone from a different department or division for some particular project or trip</i>. How would you feel, after promising in a formal meeting to assign one of your employees to an urgent project, to discover that someone else, without direct authority, has committed one of your subordinates to a task without attempting to notify you?</li>
						<li><i>Dealings with customers or outsiders, with particular reference to making promises or commitments involving another department</i>. In this connection bear in mind that the manager of the department for which you would make such promises may have very good reasons not to want them made or not to be able to keep them. You simply do not have authority to commit other departments without the responsible manager's prior approval.</li>
						<li><i>Performing any function assigned to another department or individual</i>. Violations of this law often cause bitter resentment and untold mischief. The law itself is based upon three underlying principles:
							<ol>
								<li>Most people strongly dislike having anyone "muscle" into their territory, undermining their job by appropriating their functions.</li>
								<li>Such interference fosters confusion and mistakes. The individual who is in charge of the job usually knows much more about it than you do, and, even when you think you know enough about it, the chances are better than even that you'll overlook some important factor.</li>
								<li>Whenever you are performing the other person's function you are probably neglecting your own. It is rare that engineers or executives are caught up enough with their own responsibilities that they can afford to take on those of their colleagues.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>There is a significant commentary on this last principle that should also be observed: In general you will get no credit or thanks for doing the other person's job at the expense of your own. But it frequently happens that, if you can put your own house in order first, an understanding of and an active interest in the affairs of others will lead to promotion to a position of greater responsibility. More than a few employees have been moved up primarily because of a demonstrated capacity for helping to take care of other people's business as well as their own.</p>

					<p>It is all too easy, especially in a large corporation, to overlook the interests of a department or individual who does not happen to be represented, or in mind, when a significant step is taken. Very often the result is that the step has to be retraced or else considerable damage is done. Even when it does no apparent harm, most people do not like to be left out when they have a stake in the matter, and the effect upon morale may be serious. Of course there will be crisis times when you cannot wait to stand on ceremony and you will have to steam full speed ahead with little regard for personal consequences. But you cannot do it with impunity too often.</p>
					<p>Note particularly that in this and the preceding rule the chief offense lies in the invasion of someone else's territory without that person's knowledge and consent. You may find it expedient on occasion to do parts of other people's jobs in order to get your own work done, but you should first give them a fair chance to deliver on their own or else agree to have you take over. If you must offend in this respect, at least you should realize that you are being offensive.</p>

					<p>Many engineers fail to realize this, or habitually try to dodge the responsibility for making commitments. You must make promises based upon your own estimates for the part of the job for which you are responsible, together with estimates obtained from contributing departments for their parts. No one should be allowed to avoid the issue by the old formula, "I can't give a promise because it depends upon so many uncertain factors." Consider the "uncertain factors" confronting a department head who must make up a budget for an entire engineering department for a year in advance! Even the most uncertain case can be narrowed down by first asking, "Will it be done in a matter of a few hours or a few months, a few days or a few weeks?" It usually turns out that it cannot be done in less than three weeks and surely will not require more than five, in which case you'd better say four weeks. This allows one week for contingencies and sets you a reasonable miss under the comfortable figure of five weeks. Both extremes are bad; good engineers will set schedules that they can meet by energetic effort at a pace commensurate with the significance of the job.</p>
					<p>As a corollary of the foregoing, you have a right to insist upon having estimates from responsible representatives of other departments. But in accepting promises, or statements of facts, it is frequently important to make sure that you are dealing with a properly qualified representative. Also bear in mind that when you ignore or discount other engineers' promises you dismiss their responsibility and incur the extra liability yourself. Of course this is sometimes necessary, but be sure that you do it advisedly. Ideally, other engineers' promises should be reliable instruments in compiling estimates.</p>

					<p>This is another one of those elementary propositions that everyone will endorse and yet many will carelessly violate. It's bad business: bad for you, bad for the job, and bad for your employees. You must delegate responsibility even if you could cover all of the ground yourself. It isn't wise to have so much depend upon one person, and it's unfair to your subordinates. Executives should have their business organized so that they could be away on business or vacation at any time and still have everything go along smoothly. The most common excuse for hogging the whole job is that subordinates are too young or inexperienced. It's part of your job to develop your subordinates, which includes developing initiative, resourcefulness, and judgment. The best way to do this is to load them up with all the responsibility they can carry without danger of serious embarrassment to any person or group. Selfrespecting engineers resent being babied to an extent where they cannot act on even the most trivial detail without express approval of their manager.</p>
					<p>On the other hand, it must be granted that details are not always trivial, and that it may sometimes require a meeting of an executive committee to change the length of a screw in a critically important mass-produced assembly. It is a matter of making sure not only that technical items are handled by engineers of appropriate competence and experience but that all considerations have been made (Rabbe).</p>

					<p>Since there usually isn't time for everything, it is essential to form the habit of concentrating on the important things first. The important things are the things for which you are held directly responsible and accountable, and if you aren't sure what these are you'd better find out mighty quick and fix them clearly in your mind. Assign these responsibilities top priority in budgeting your time; then delegate as many as possible of the items that will not fit into your schedule. It is a good general rule never to undertake any minor project or chore that you can get someone else or some other department to do for you, so long as it is not an essential part of your job. For example, if your job is building motors it is a mistake to spend time designing special vibration or sound meters for testing them if you can get a laboratory or service to do it for you.</p>
					<p>The practice of drawing upon all available resources for assistance can frequently be applied to advantage in respect to your major products, as well as in minor details. This is especially true in a large organization where the services of experts, consulting engineers, laboratories, and other departments are available; they will almost always be able to get an answer far more efficiently than you could independently. In fact, there will be cases in which it would be wise for you to limit yourself, personally or as a business manager, to performing only those functions to which you can bring some special talent, skill, or contribution, or in which you enjoy some natural advantage. The common belief that everyone can do anything if they just try hard enough is a formula for inefficiency at best and for complete failure at worst. Few of us are versatile enough to excel in more than a very few talents.</p>

					<p>The faculty for reducing apparently complicated situations to their basic, essential elements is a form of wisdom that must usually be derived from experience, but there are marked differences between otherwise comparable individuals in this respect. Some people seem eternally disposed to "muddy the water"; or they "can never see the forest for the trees." Perhaps one cannot correct such an innate tendency simply by taking thought, but it appears to be largely a habit — a habit of withdrawing mentally to a suitable vantage point so as to survey a mass of facts in their proper perspective, or a habit of becoming immersed and lost in a sea of detail. Make it a practice to integrate, condense, summarize, and simplify your facts rather than expand, ramify, complicate, and disintegrate them.</p>
					<p>Many meetings, for example, get nowhere after protracted wrangling until somebody finally says "Well, it all boils down simply to this . . .," or "Can't we agree, however, that the basic point at issue is just this ...,", or "After all, the essential fact remains that . . . .

					<p>Some managers carry their aversion for large meetings to the point of phobia. It is true enough that large meetings frequently dissipate the subject over a number of conflicting or irrelevant points of view in a generally superficial manner. But this is almost entirely because of the competence of the person leading the meeting. A considerable amount of skill is required to manage a sizable meeting so as to keep it on the proper subject, avoiding long-winded digressions or reiterations of the arguments. It should be the function of the chairperson, or the presiding manager, to bring out the pertinent facts bearing upon the matter, in their logical order, and then to secure agreement upon the various issues by asking for general assent to concrete proposals, taking a vote, or making discretionary decisions. Engineering meetings may degenerate into protracted quarrels for lack of competent direction. This danger seems to be proportionate to the size of the meeting.</p>
					<p>Small meetings (three or four persons) can usually hammer out a program or dispose of perplexing problems much more effectively. The chief drawback lies in the very serious possibility that all interested parties may not be represented, and considerable mischief may result from failing to take account of significant facts or points of view. Apart from any actual loss involved, strong resentment or discouragement may be aroused in the neglected parties.</p>
					<p>There will doubtless be cases in which it is neither feasible nor desirable to have all interested parties represented in engineering discussions, particularly if the participants are well informed. But in general it is fitting, proper, and helpful to have present those whose particular territory is under discussion. An excellent means for avoiding the objections to either extreme in this respect is to keep the meeting small, calling in key individuals when their particular responsibilities are being discussed.</p>
					<p>Along this same line, a worthwhile guideline to observe is to limit attendees to two levels of the organizational structure, especially for working, decision-making meetings (informational meetings are another matter). A third or fourth level in attendance has no decision-making power anyway, practically speaking. Aside from the exception of presenting information their presence is usually wasteful. On the other hand, if lower levels can make decisions on the items being discussed, attendance by the higher level people is even more wasteful; higher-up participants often detrimentally dominate the discussion and decisions.</p>
					<p>In any meeting the important thing is to face the issues and dispose of them. All too often there is a tendency to dodge the issues, postponing action until a later date, or "letting the matter work itself out naturally." Matters will always work out "naturally" if the executive function of control is neglected, but this represents a low order of management. Count any meeting a failure that does not end up with a definite understanding as to what's going to be done, who's going to do it, and when, and this should be confirmed in written minutes.</p>

					<p>This is, of course, the most difficult and important part of a manager's job. Some managers have a terrific struggle deciding even minor issues, mainly because they never get over being afraid of making mistakes. Normally, facility comes with practice, but it can be hastened by observing a few simple principles.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Decisions will be easier and more frequently correct if you have the essential facts at hand. It will therefore pay you to keep well informed, or else to bring out the relevant facts before attempting a decision. However, it is sometimes said that anybody can make decisions when all of the facts are at hand, whereas a good manager will make the same decisions without waiting for the facts (Osborne). To maintain a proper balance in this respect, when in doubt ask yourself: "Am I likely to lose more by giving a snap judgment or by waiting for more information?"</li>
						<li>The application of judgment can be facilitated by formulating it into principles, policies, and precepts in advance. The present chapter is an attempt to formulate experience for this purpose. Make up your own code, if you will, but at least have some sort of code, for much the same reason that you memorize physical constants or Newton's laws of motion.</li>
						<li>You do not have to be right every time. It is said that a good executive needs to be right only 51 percent of the time (although a better margin will serve you proportionately better).</li>
						<li>The very fact that a decision is difficult usually means that the advantages and drawbacks of the various alternatives are pretty well balanced, so that the net loss cannot amount to much in any event. In such cases it is frequently more important to arrive at some decision — any decision — promptly than to arrive at the best decision ultimately. So take a definite position and see it through.</li>
						<li>It is futile to try to keep everybody happy in deciding issues involving several incompatible points of view. By all means give everyone a fair hearing, but after all parties have had their say and all facts are on the table, dispose of the matter decisively even if someone's toes are stepped on. Otherwise the odds are that everyone will end up dissatisfied, and even the chief beneficiary will think less of you for straddling the issues.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The following criteria are helpful in choosing a course of action when the factors are indecisive; ask yourself these questions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Does it expedite and forward the undertaking, or does it only produce procrastination and delay?</li>
						<li>Is it fair and square and aboveboard?</li>
						<li>Is it in line with established custom, precedence, or policy? A good reason is generally required for a departure.</li>
						<li>Is it in line with a previous specific decision or understanding? Even a good reason for making a change will sometimes not offset the unfortunate impression of apparent instability. "He can't make up his own mind" is a common reaction. (Observe, however, that this criterion is suggested only "when other factors are indecisive." By all means have the courage of your convictions when the change is justifiable.)</li>
						<li>What are the odds? Can we accept the risk? How does the possible penalty compare with the possible gain in each of the alternatives offered? Very often you can find a solution wherein the worst possible consequence isn't too bad, in relation to the possible gains.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Do not allow the danger of making a mistake to inhibit your initiative to the point of "nothing ventured, nothing gained." It is much healthier to expect to make mistakes, take a few good risks now and then, and take your medicine when you lose. Moreover, there are few mistakes that cannot be turned into profit somehow, even if only for the experience.</p>
					<p>On the opposite side, never mistake the true meaning of the statement, "Don't be afraid to make mistakes." Incorrect decisions that result in catastrophic consequences such as huge financial losses or personal injury will not be overlooked. Such decisions may even be criminal conduct. Those who coerce you into making decisions, despite whatever aphorisms they may employ toward that end, do not expect and will not accept a catastrophic result. Indeed, don't be afraid to make mistakes; make clear-cut, swift decisions, but only if a mistake won't create wreckage for your organization — and you.</p>

					<p>When time permits, it is frequently good diplomacy to prepare the ground for such announcements by discussing the matter in advance with various key personnel or directly interested parties. This is, in fact, an elementary technique in diplomatic and political procedure, but it is all too often ignored in engineering practice. Much embarrassment and bad feeling can be caused by announcing a major change or embarking upon a new program or policy without consulting those directly affected or those who are apt to bring up violent objections later on (Schell).</p>

					<p>Although this rule apples to any activity just as well as it does to production planning, this seems to be a particularly common — and devilish — error. Although not a hard and fast rule, in many organizations, it is common that someone responsible for design engineering is also the one to manage the overall development project. Everyone, designers included, has the natural tendency to become preoccupied with one's own problems and areas of expertise, and to underestimate or even ignore those of other departments or disciplines. Considerable foresight is required to offset this natural tendency, for inadequate planning and execution of the "whole" project is poor project management. Even when a new design is no more than old fundamentals in a new cloak, it is important to plan the program early enough and to provide for all stages in the process of getting the product on the market. Items or activities as remote from design engineering as inventory planning, regulatory approval, user's instructions, or promotional materials are every bit as important to successfully completing product development as are design engineering, process development, or assembly fixtures.</p>

					<p>Too much preoccupation with the pursuit of security is apt to lead to greater danger and insecurity. In a competitive world you must take chances — bold and courageous chances — or else others will, and they will win out just often enough to keep you running, all out of breath, trying to catch up. So it behooves you as an engineering manager to undertake stiff development programs, thereby setting a high mark, and then working aggressively to meet it. With competent direction any representative engineering organization will work its way out of a tight spot under the pressure of the emergency. If you do not create your own emergencies in advance, your competition will create them for you at a much more embarrassing time later on.</p>
					<p>In order to minimize the risk inherent in aggressive programs (technical or schedule challenges included), it is good policy to hedge against failure by providing an alternative, or an "out" to fall back on, wherever practicable.

Still, the amount of dependency should be kept to the practical minimum, for it is extremely difficult for employees to get anything done if they must eternally solicit the voluntary cooperation or approval of too many other parties.</p>
					<p>Bestowing or acquiring the needed authority is difficult and delicate. A fine line exists between being authoritative and being overbearing, but a clear line exists between the resulting effectiveness or impotence. The important thing is to exercise sufficient care to avoid running afoul of the interests and authority of others.</p>
					<p>In reality, employees will frequently be held responsible for a good deal more than they can control by directly delegated authority. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of authority can be assumed with complete impunity if it is assumed discreetly, and with effective results. In general we tend to obey people who appear to be in charge of any situation, provided that they appear to know what they are doing and obtain the desired results. Most managers, yourself included, should be pleased to confirm such authority in their subordinates when they see it being exercised effectively. Therefore, you should encourage yourself and your subordinates to assume, albeit delicately, however much authority is needed to do the job.</p>

					<p>At high levels in a chain-of-command, supervisors and subordinates will oftentimes have dissimilar training and experience. But in an engineering organization, at least ideally, every novice engineer working in a technological area should be supervised by a veteran seasoned in the same area. Neophytes can get themselves, their departments, their employers, and their supervisors into embarrassingly difficult spots if left on their own.</p>
					<p>As a manager, you should offer your subordinates complete competence and instill in them the same when overseeing them in their technical activities. If you are uncomfortable with this responsibility, you'd better do something about it, and with all due haste. A particularly good method to use, outside of directly learning what you need to know, is to complement yourself with other experienced people under your supervision, people who can properly judge what you cannot, thereby shoring up any breaks in your expertise. Another method is to assign technical as well as project responsibilities to every engineer in the organization, and then have the technical experts act as consultants for others. Matrix organizations can excel at assuring such interactions.</p>
					<p>As a final consideration, recognize the limitations regarding how many subordinates one can adequately manage. The conventional guideline, in keeping with traditional organizational theory, is not to have more than six or seven people report to one supervisor. Adhering to a rigid standard in this regard is excessive, what with organizations and individuals each being unique, but never deprive an employee of adequate supervision because of a lopsided reporting structure.</p>

					<p>The most serious responsibility of managers is to review the performance of their subordinates. As a manager, you have the distinct obligation to do this as accurately as possible.

To be sure, this is not always easy, and it will require much tact to avoid discouraging or offending them, but you owe it to them. Bear this in mind: If you ultimately must fire a subordinate, you may have two pointed questions to answer: "Why has it taken you five years to discover my incompetence?" and "Why haven't you given me a fair chance to correct these shortcomings?" Remember that when you fire someone for incompetence, it means not only that the employee has failed, but also that you have failed.</p>

					<p>In the catalog of raw deals, next to responsibility without authority comes responsibility without information. It is very unfair to ask engineers to acquit themselves creditably when they are held responsible for a project without having adequate knowledge of its past history, present status, or future plans. An excellent practice is to hold occasional meetings to acquaint employees with major policies and developments in the business of the department and the company.</p>
					<p>An important part of the job of developing engineers is to furnish them with ample background knowledge in their particular domain, and as a rule this involves a certain amount of travel. There are occasions when it is worthwhile to send young engineers along on trips for what they can get out of a job, regardless of how little they can directly contribute. Likewise, include interested individuals in introductions, luncheons, and so on, when hosting visitors. Obviously, this can be overdone, but when outsiders visit, it is good business, as well as good manners, to invite all the involved internal persons to participate as well.</p>

For example, if you're sending an engineer to his or her home town on a business trip, allow some schedule flexibility so that the employee can spend some free time there, if it makes no difference otherwise. Considerations of this sort make a nice difference in the matter of morale and in the satisfaction a manager gets out of the job. Treat your people as human beings making up a team rather than as cogs in a machine.</p>
					<p>To be sure, managers have the right to inconvenience their subordinates, but they should also embrace the responsibility to avoid doing so whenever possible. Managers who insist, at every opportunity, upon flagrantly displaying power over their subordinates by disrupting their personal lives can expect bitterness and resentment in return.</p>

					<p>A number of empirical studies of on-the-job excellence have clearly and repeatedly established that emotional competencies — communication, interpersonal skills, self-control, and so on — "play a far larger role in superior job performance than do cognitive abilities and technical expertise" (Goleman, p. 320). Yet most of the emphasis in the education and training of engineers is placed upon purely technical education.</p>
					<p>Notwithstanding some brilliant exceptions, intelligence, academic training, technical knowledge, and circumstantial expertise alone are not major determinants in the success or failure of engineers in the workplace. For the most part, engineers are or can quickly become adequately capable in these areas. If technically incapable, they almost certainly would have been discharged from the system, either by themselves or by others, long before they became employed engineers. Generally, such skills and traits as communication, confidence, group and interpersonal effectiveness, motivation, pride in accomplishments, adaptability, leadership potential, inquisitiveness, integrity, and emotional control are exhibited by the most successful employees, just as with the most successful among engineers.</p>
					<p>It should be obvious enough that a highly trained technical expert with a good character and personality is necessarily a better engineer and a great deal more valuable as an employee than a sociological freak or misfit with the same technical training. This is largely a consequence of the elementary observation that in a normal organization one cannot get very far in accomplishing anything worthwhile without the voluntary cooperation of one's associates; and the quantity and quality of such cooperation is determined by the "personality factor" as much as anything else. Added to this need for one-on-one cooperation are all sorts of "soft" characteristics from understanding contemporary society to following ethical behavior — all of which can add up to benefits for yourself and your employer far beyond ordinary technical contributions.</p>
					<p>The following "laws" are drawn up from the purely practical point of view. As in the two preceding sections, the selections are limited to rules that are frequently violated, with unfortunate results, however obvious or stale they may appear.</p>

					<p>This is rather a comprehensive quality but it defines the prime requisite of personality in any type of industrial organization. No doubt this ability can be achieved by various formulas, although it is probably based mostly upon general, good-natured friendliness, together with fairly consistent observance of the "Golden Rule." The following "do's and don'ts" are more specific elements of such a formula.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b><i>Cultivate the tendency to appreciate the good qualities, rather than the shortcomings, of each individual.</i></b></li>
						<li><b><i>Do not give vent to impatience and annoyance on slight provocation.</i></b> Some offensive individuals seem to develop a striking capacity for becoming annoyed, which they indulge with little or no restraint.</li>
						<li><b><i>Do not harbor grudges after disagreements involving honest differences of opinion.</i></b> Keep your arguments objective and leave personalities out as much as possible. You never want to create enemies, for as E. B. White put it: "One of the most time-consuming things is to have an enemy."</li>
						<li><b><i>Form the habit of considering the feelings and interests of others.</i></b></li>
						<li><b><i>Do not become unduly preoccupied with your own selfish interests.</i></b> It is natural enough to "look out for Number One first," but when you do, your associates will be noticeably disinclined to look out for you, because they know you already are. This applies particularly to the matter of credit for accomplishments. It is much wiser to give your principal attention to the matter of getting the job done, or to building up your associates than to spend too much time pushing your personal interests ahead of everything else. You need have no fear of being overlooked; about the only way to lose credit for a creditable job is to grab for it too avidly.</li>
						<li><b><i>Make it a rule to help the other person whenever an opportunity arises.</i></b> Even if you're mean-spirited enough to derive no personal satisfaction from accommodating others, it's a good investment. The business world demands and expects cooperation and teamwork among the members of an organization. It is smarter and more pleasant to give it freely and ungrudgingly (up to the point of unduly neglecting your own responsibilities).</li>
						<li><b><i>Be particularly careful to be fair on all occasions.</i></b> This means a good deal more than just fair upon demand. All of us are frequently unfair, unintentionally, simply because we do not habitually view matters from other points of view to ensure that the interests of others are fairly protected. For example, an individual who fails to carry out an assignment is sometimes unjustly criticized when the real fault lies with the manager who failed to provide the tools to do the job. Whenever you enjoy some natural advantage, or whenever you are in a position to mistreat someone seriously, it is especially incumbent upon you to "lean over backwards" to be fair and square.</li>
						<li><b><i>Do not take yourself or your work too seriously.</i></b> A normal healthy sense of humor, under reasonable control, is much more becoming, even to an executive, than a chronically sour dead-pan, a perpetually unrelieved air of tedious seriousness, or a pompous righteousness. It is much better for your blood pressure, and for the morale of the office, to laugh off an awkward situation now and then than to maintain a tense, tragic atmosphere of stark disaster whenever matters take an embarrassing turn. To be sure, a serious matter should be taken seriously, and employees should maintain a quiet dignity as a rule, but it does more harm than good to preserve an oppressively heavy and funereal atmosphere around you.</li>
						<li><b><i>Put yourself out just a little to be genuinely cordial in greeting people.</i></b> True cordiality is, of course, spontaneous and should never be affected, but neither should it be inhibited. We all know people who invariably pass us in the hall or encounter us elsewhere without a shadow of recognition. Whether this is due to inhibition or preoccupation, we cannot help feeling that such unsociable chumps would not be missed much if we just didn't see them. On the other hand, it is difficult to think of anyone who is too cordial, although it can doubtless be overdone like anything else. It appears that most people tend naturally to be sufficiently reserved or else, as is common with engineers, over-reserved.</li>
						<li><b><i>Give people the benefit of the doubt if you are inclined to suspect their motives, especially when you can afford to do so.</i></b> Mutual distrust and suspicion breed a great deal of absolutely unnecessary friction and trouble, frequently of a very serious nature. It is derived chiefly from misunderstandings, pure ignorance, or from an ungenerous tendency to assume that people are guilty until proven innocent. No doubt the latter assumption is the "safer" bet, but it is also true that if you treat others as depraved scoundrels, they will usually treat you likewise, and they will probably try to live down to what is expected of them. On the other hand you will get much better cooperation from your associates and others if you assume that they are just as intelligent, reasonable, and decent as you are, even when you know they are not (although setting the odds of that are tricky indeed!). Do not fear being taken as naive or gullible; you'll gain more than you lose by this practice with anything more than casual attention to the actual odds in each case.</li>

					<p>It is a mistake, of course, to try too hard to get along with everybody merely by being agreeable or even submissive on all occasions. Somebody will take advantage of you sooner or later, and you cannot avoid trouble simply by running away from it. Do not give ground too quickly just to avoid a fight, when you know you're in the right. If you can be pushed around easily the chances are that you will be pushed around. Indeed, you can earn the respect of your associates by demonstrating your readiness to engage in a good (albeit non-personal) fight when your objectives are worth fighting for. Shakespeare put it succinctly in Polonius's advice to his son (in Hamlet): "Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, bear't that the opposed may beware of thee."</p>
					<p>Like it or not, as long as you're in a competitive business you're in a fight; sometimes it's a fight between departments of the same company. As long as it's a good clean fight, with no hitting below the belt, it's perfectly healthy. But keep it to "friendly competition" as long as you can. In the case of arguments with your colleagues, it is usually better policy to settle your differences "out of court," rather than to take them higher for arbitration.</p>
					<p>Likewise, in your relations with subordinates it is unwise to carry friendliness to the extent of impairing discipline. Every one of your employees should know that whenever they deserve a reprimand, they'll get it, every time. The most rigid discipline is not resented so long as it is reasonable, impartial, and fair, especially when it is balanced by appropriate praise, appreciation, and compensation. At the extreme, there may well be times when firing or transferring an employee is the best course of action, both for the person involved and for the company. If you do not face your issues squarely, someone else will be put in your place who will.</p>

					<p>In the long run there is hardly anything more important to you than your own self-respect, and this alone should provide ample incentive to maintain the highest standards for honesty and sincerity of which you are capable. But, apart from all considerations of ethics and morals, there are perfectly sound business reasons for conscientiously guarding the integrity of your character.</p>
					<p>The integrity to which we refer is easily described: if you have high personal integrity, you are honest, morally sound, trustworthy, responsible, and sincere. The priceless and inevitable reward for uncompromising integrity is confidence: the confidence of associates, subordinates, and outsiders. All transactions are enormously simplified and facilitated when your word is as good as your bond and your motives are above question. Confidence is such an invaluable business asset that even a moderate amount of it will easily outweigh any temporary advantage that might be gained by having lost it.</p>
					<p>A most striking phenomenon in an engineering office, once it is pointed out, is the transparency of character among members who have been associated for any length of time. In a surprisingly short period individuals are recognized, appraised, and catalogued for exactly what they are, with far greater accuracy than they usually realize. This makes anyone appear downright ludicrous when assuming a pose or trying to convince us that they are something other than they are. As Ralph Waldo Emerson puts it: "What you are . . . thunders so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary." Therefore, it behooves you to let your personal conduct, overtly and covertly, represent the very best practical standard of personal and professional integrity by which you would like to let the world judge and rate you.</p>
					<p>Moreover, it is morally healthy and creates a better atmosphere if you will credit the other person with similar standards of integrity. The obsessing and overpowering fear of being cheated is a common characteristic of substandard personalities. This sort of psychology sometimes leads one to credit oneself with being impressively clever when one is simply taking advantage of those who are more considerate and fair-minded.</p>
					<p>In order to avoid any misunderstanding, it should be granted here that the average person, and certainly the average engineer, is by no means a low, dishonest scoundrel. In fact, the average person would violently protest any questioning of his or her essential honesty and decency, perhaps fairly enough. But the average person will often compromise whenever it becomes moderately uncomfortable to live up to his or her obligations. This is hardly what is meant by integrity, and it is difficult to base even moderate confidence upon the guarantee that you will not be deceived — unless the going gets tough.</p>

					<p>Upon becoming a member of the engineering profession, you accepted the responsibility of a professional as well as any liability that accompanies that responsibility, be it personal, professional, or corporate. Many engineers pretend that they can hide behind their employer's or their department's shield, or that they are powerless, mere cogs in the machinery, even if, or especially if, something goes haywire. Although environmental, consumer, and product safety concerns are every individual's responsibility, an engineer, perhaps more than anyone, is uniquely positioned with the power and knowledge to create, identify, avoid, and correct such problems — an incongruous reality. Regardless of the size of your employer, never forget that, in the end, you contribute to making decisions, whether the results are good, bad, or catastrophic.</p>
					<p>All this responsibility and liability will tempt you towards, but must not lead you to inaction and indecision. You needn't be unreasonably anxious; you are in your position as an engineer presumably because you have or can somehow bring to bear the training, knowledge, and experience to identify and judge the risks inherent in doing your business. Do your job responsibly, and you minimize liability all around. In this regard you will serve yourself, your employer, and your profession well if you follow a few simple guidelines:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Approach all of your engineering systematically, especially when developing new products, processes, or equipment.</li>
						<li>Identify and apply the requisite expertise to all engineering activities.</li>
						<li>Be aware of and use applicable codes and standards.</li>
						<li>Use established procedures for design reviews and failure analyses.</li>

					<p>Despite the usual ambiguities and everyday quandaries of engineering, ethical behavior usually comes naturally to engineers. Societal values — the basis for ethics — are ingrained. On the other hand, many times the ethical problems encountered in engineering practice are very complex and involve conflicting ethical principles (Fleddermann, p. 3). The accounts of many well-known cases of injurious product failures and tragic man-made disasters prove the point.</p>
					<p>It should be observed that having the courage of your convictions includes having the courage to do what you know to be right, technically as well as ethically and morally, without undue fear of possible criticism or of the need to explain your actions. If your reasons for your actions are sound, you should not worry about having to defend them to anyone; if they're not sound you'd better correct them promptly, instead of building up an elaborate camouflage.</p>
					<p>Understand, you are ill-advised to martyr yourself for every controversial matter in which you strongly believe. Martin Luther King, Jr. said: "If a man hasn't discovered something that he will die for, he isn't fit to live." True enough, but Oscar Wilde said: "A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it." Martyrdom only rarely makes heroes, and in the business world, such heroes and martyrs alike often find themselves unemployed.</p>
					<p>Knowing what is ethically right, both for you and for your company, and then acting appropriately is the key. Professional societies offer good places to start with their codes of ethics, some of which are appended in this book.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Look at how those in the positions to which you aspire are dressed and groomed, then follow their lead.</li>
						<li>Dress appropriately for the occasion, whatever it is, including everyday work. When in doubt, slightly overdressing is prudent; being noticeably underdressed, at least for most people most of the time, is unbearably uncomfortable.</li>

					<p>Despite the wide range of acceptable personal appearance within any one office, and the vastly greater range to be found in society overall, it's hard to argue against these common-sense points.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Clothing, regardless of style, should be clean, well-fitting, and in good condition.</li>
						<li>Hair and nails should be clean and well-kept, again regardless of style.</li>
						<li>Your good personal hygiene will be appreciated by your colleagues.</li>

They all must accept whatever the consequence is of their personal appearance, whether they like it or not, and so must you.</p>

					<p>You will be well served if you simply avoid using profane language. Not using profanity will never be offensive to anyone. On the other hand, using profanity may well be offensive, even without your knowing it.</p>
					<p>To be sure, obscene and vulgar language is routinely heard in some circles. Unfortunately, in the professional workplace, such language is sometimes used for its "effect." Some think it a mark of power, strength, or vigor. The trouble in using profanity is that its actual effect is known only to the listener, who may conclude something quite different about the speaker from what was intended. Regardless, blatantly obscene language serves no one properly, and a really foul mouth will generally inspire nothing but contempt.</p>

					<p>There is simply no room in the workplace for harassment or discrimination of any kind. Blatant infractions will get employees and employers into big trouble, as most people know, but big trouble can also come from subtler forms of these unacceptable behaviors. The "harmless" off-color joke and slightly misguided comment can also offend, and are not acceptable.</p>
					<p>Of course, no one likes the self-appointed police officer who is constantly on the look-out for rule violations or who constantly cautions colleagues about workplace behavior. Confronting a colleague or subordinate on such matters must itself be handled discretely and delicately. Your best course of action, whether you are a target or an observer of suspected harassment or discrimination, depends upon the circumstances. You may choose to informally approach the alleged offender directly, but any formal discipline should be handled together with your manager, personnel department, or both.</p>

Sooner or later, for one reason or another, your employer will no longer be interested in buying those skills, and you will have no place else to sell them.</p>

It is costly for employers to disposition the obsolete, and to hire or develop employees with the skills that the departed should have been developing all along.

					<p>Engineers and engineering managers need not be students of psychology — most are disinclined anyway. Nevertheless, it is enlightening to appreciate that people, including yourself, behave as they do not so much because they want to behave that way, but rather because that is how they are. Fundamentally, people see and react to things, and judge and decide things quite differently from one another. Even without fully understanding different personality types, simply recognizing that people are remarkably different will help you accept different personalities as normal, and not to view them as somehow wrong.</p>
					<p>Among the important decisions for engineers to make for themselves or their subordinates are when and how much managerial and administrative responsibility is appropriate. It has been assumed in all the foregoing that any normal individual will be interested in either: (a) advancement to a position of greater responsibility, or (b) improvement in personal effectiveness as regards quantity and quality of accomplishment. Either of these should result in increased financial compensation and satisfaction derived from the job. As to item (a), it is all too often taken for granted that increased executive and administrative responsibility is a desirable and appropriate form of reward for outstanding proficiency in any type of work. There should be other ways of rewarding an employee for outstanding accomplishment, for such rewards may be a mistake from either of two points of view:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>People are sometimes surprised to find that they are much less happy in a new, higher-level job than they thought they were going to be. It is not uncommon for engineers or scientists to discover, to their dismay, that as soon as they become managers they no longer have time to be engineers or scientists.</li>
						<li>It by no means follows that a good engineer will make a good manager. Many top-notch technologists have been promoted to administrative positions much to their own and their employer's detriment.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>These facts should therefore be considered carefully by the person threatened with promotion and by the person about to do the promoting. It is not always easy, however, to decide in advance whether you, or the employee in question, would be happier and more effective as more of a manager and less of an individual worker, or vice versa. There is no infallible criterion for this purpose but it will be found that, in general, the two types are distinguished by the characteristics and qualities listed in the accompanying table.</p>
					<p>Although nobody fits neatly into one column or the other, a preponderance of engineers has the qualities of the specialist column. This seems to be especially true for engineers just starting their careers; most will have been drawn to engineering because they have these characteristics. This, no doubt, is the source of the conventional stereotype of the engineer. But beware — you do a grave disservice to those who you assume fit this stereotype simply because they are engineers. Everyone is a unique blend. Furthermore, none of these characteristics should be considered better or worse than its counterpart, but each is quite clearly different from the other.</p>
					<p>In reality, nobody successfully moving through an engineering career can avoid management and administration altogether.</p>

					<p>These are necessary parts of all job descriptions, and a certain amount of managing projects and supervising others is satisfying for all but the most narrow-minded technologist. Further, as time goes by, many engineers find their interest in management changing, often increasing as their career matures.</p>
					<p>Although certain personality types are more disposed to become managers in their careers, and some personality characteristics seem to be more common than others in successful managers, any personality type can be that of a successful manager, and no personality characteristic precludes someone from managerial success. We all know the reserved, introspective, or intellectual, yet highly effective manager. What makes a successful manager, and whether or not a person will thrive as a manager, is more complicated than simply matching up a few traits. Indeed, those who choose to become managers can become successful regardless of their traits by manipulating their situations and selecting their styles to make the best use of strengths and to deemphasize weaknesses. Perhaps as important as anything, upon becoming, or in anticipation of becoming, a newly promoted manager, anyone is well advised to seek the knowledge and training required to succeed. Time and again it is all too clear how seriously ill-equipped many engineers, with their technical training alone, are to be managers.</p>
					<p>As regards analyzing yourself and your subordinates, some final good advice for anyone is: Do what you do best; you will also be the happiest. Try to improve your best traits and make them the most visible. Of course, try to improve anything of yourself that people could consider substandard, but trying to become expert, or even proficient at something for which you have little natural talent is futile. It is often better to minimize the harm by making it unnecessary in your job or invisible in your behavior. Analyze yourself and then emphasize the positive!</p>

			<p>The foregoing "laws" represent only one element in the general formula for a successful engineering career. However much natural interest you take in these principles — and each person has his or her own level — it will pay for you to contemplate at least a little of the "rules of the game" to develop your own set of principles and practices to guide you through your professional career. To engineers interested in improving their professional effectiveness further, study in not only technical, but also in professional and administrative subjects is recommended; there is no shortage of published material to be found in bookstores and libraries. Finally, it should be observed that the various principles that have been presented, just like those of science and engineering, must be assiduously applied and developed in practice if they are to become effective assets.</p>
