		<h1>The 8 Habits of Highly Effective People</h1>
		<p><strong>Habit 1: Be Proactive</strong> - “I am a responsible person. I take initiative. I choose my actions, attitudes, and moods. I do not blame others for my mistakes. I can only be offended if I choose to be.”</p>
		<p><strong>Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind</strong> - “I plan ahead and set goals. I do things that have meaning and make a difference. I am an important part of my classroom and contribute to my school’s mission and vision, and look for ways to be a good citizen.”</p>
		<p><strong>Habit 3: Put First Things First</strong> - “I spend my time on things that are most important. This means I say <strong><i>no</i></strong> to things I know I should not do. I set priorities, make a schedule, and follow my plan. I am disciplined and organized.”</p>
		<p><strong>Habit 4: Think Win-Win</strong> “I balance courage for getting what I want with consideration for what others want. I make deposits in others’ Emotional Bank Accounts. When conflicts arise, I look for options that work on both sides.”</p>
		<p><strong>Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood</strong> - “I listen to other people’s ideas and feelings. I try to see things from their viewpoints. I listen to others without interrupting. I am confident in voicing my ideas. I look people in the eyes when talking.”</p>
		<p><strong>Habit 6: Synergize</strong> - “I value other people’s strengths and learn from them. I get along well with others, even people who are different than me. I work well in groups. I seek out other people’s ideas to solve problems because I know that by teaming with others, we can create better solutions than any one of us alone. I am humble.”</p>
		<p><strong>Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw</strong> - “I take care of my body by eating right, exercising, and getting sleep. I spend time with family and friends. I learn in lots of ways and lots of places, not just at school. I take time to find meaningful ways to help others.”</p>
		<p><strong>Habit 8: Find Your Voice, And Inspire Others To Find Theirs</strong> - “I use my talents to make a contribution. I can identify my strengths. I pursue my passions. I look for ways to help others. I make the world better.”</p>
